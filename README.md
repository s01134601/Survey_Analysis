## Survey_Analysis
I conduct statistically analyses on a survey with 1k+ responses (with 800+ cleaned entries). In particular, I use ANOVA and kruskal-wallis test to examine whether different ethnic and gender groups show significant differences in their responses to survey questions. 
Through the ANOVA test, I learned that the data-points in each group cannot be assumed to be normally distributed. Thus, I use kruskal-wallis test, which does not assume normality, to show whether the differences between groups are statistically significant.
